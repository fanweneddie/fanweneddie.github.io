Hi, I am Wen Fan (范文), a third-year PhD student at Purdue ECE, advised by Dr. [Jenna DiVincenzo](https://jennalwise.github.io/). I am interested in program verification.

I got my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2022, where I was honored to work with Prof. [Yongkun Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ykli/).
