Hi, I am Wen Fan (范文), a second-year master student at Purdue CS. I am interested in distributed protocols (e.g., Paxos).

I got my bachelor degree in CS from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2022.

Along my study, I am honored to meet and work with Prof. [Yongkun Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ykli/), Prof. [Wenchao Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=whv_2gwAAAAJ&hl=en), Prof. [Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) and Prof. [Yongle Zhang](https://yonglezh-purdue.github.io/).
