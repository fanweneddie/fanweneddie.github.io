Hi, I am Wen Fan (范文), a second-year grad student at Purdue CS. I am interested in program verification and distributed protocols.

I got my bachelor degree in CS from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2022, where I was honored to meet and work with Prof. [Yongkun Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ykli/).
