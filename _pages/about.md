Hi, I am Wen Fan(范文), a second-year PhD student from Purdue CS, advised by Prof. [Yongle Zhang](https://yonglezh-purdue.github.io/). I am interested in distributed protocols and formal methods.

I got my bachelor degree in CS from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2022, and I am honored to meet and work with Prof. [Yongkun Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ykli/), Prof. [Wenchao Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=whv_2gwAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) during my undergrad.
